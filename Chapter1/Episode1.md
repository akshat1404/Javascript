## What actually is javascript and why was it invented?

**Javascript is basically a programming language which can run on a browser.**

So in the early 1990's most websites had static content which could only be read or viewed like articles and documentations. Web pages containing information about a historical event or personal hobbies which can only be read but not engaged with. Images were all static, which means there was no click to zoom functionality, no image sliders or carousels to allow users to scroll through multiple images by clicking previous or next navigation buttons.
These webpages were built only on HTML and CSS. <br>
HTML defined the structure and content of the website and CSS was used to provide beauty to the web pages. To add interactivity to these more or less dead web pages, was the the very reason javascript was invented.<br>
Earlier if an HTML page contained forms, the form validation would happen in the server side i.e. checking if an email was in correct format or password met a certain criteria needed a server side round trip. With the introduction of javascript the client side validation became possible, giving instant feedback to user and preventing form submission for invalid input.
